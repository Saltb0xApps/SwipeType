SwipeType
=========

SwipeType for &lt;= iOS 7. This added keyboard shortcuts like select all, copy, paste, etc. to the default iOS keyboard (before apple bought the custom keyboard APIs)

1. Tap and hold spacebar.
2. move to any shortcut letter like 'a' (select all) or 'x' (cut selected text).
3. release finger and the corresponding shortcut takes place.

this no longer works with iOS 8 and above because there is no way for custom keyboards to select text, so most of the functions wont work (select all, copy, etc.).
